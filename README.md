# Danjuma

## Overview
Danjuma is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users with queries related to Moniepoint's services. It utilizes state-of-the-art AI technologies and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses, leveraging Moniepoint-specific knowledge.

## Features
- **Intelligent Query Resolution**: Uses RAG to retrieve and generate answers based on Moniepointâ€™s content.
- **Chat Interface**: A user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit for seamless interaction.
- **High-Performance Models**: Integrates with Together API for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Automatically fetches relevant data using IlimiKudi.

## Technology Stack
- **AI Models**: Together API
- **Frameworks**:
  - txtai for embedding-based retrieval
  - LangChain for workflow orchestration
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for the chat interface
- **Backend**:
  - Python for core logic
  - RAG for combining retrieval with generative capabilities
